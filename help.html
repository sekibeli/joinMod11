        <div class="topic">What is Join?</div>
        <p>In principle, pending tasks can be managed and processed more easily with Join. It is possible to assign employees to specific tasks. It is particularly helpful to divide extensive tasks into subtasks and thus make the progress visible to everyone.</p>
        <p>tasks can be provided with an expiry date and a priority, so that particularly urgent tasks are immediately in focus.</p>
          <p>  Of course, all tasks can also be edited afterwards.</p>
           <p>The board provides an overview of all tasks and their processing status. Tasks can be moved between the different processing statuses using drag and drop.
            After logging in, the user can immediately see all tasks and their status. New contacts can easily be created in the contacts-section.</p>

        <div class="topic">How to use it</div>
<div><ol>
    <li>Create a new task under Add Task, or click the Add Task button on the board. Paste all content and save the task.</li>
    <li>Create subtasks and work through the task as intended. Drag the task to the appropriate processing status.</li>
    <li>Be happy when the task is completed. The next will come soon.</li>
    </ol>
